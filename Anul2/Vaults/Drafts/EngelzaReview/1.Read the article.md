1. Introduction
	Notes (Some notes that seemed important):
		Nevertheless, the freedom it brings remains unchallenged and hand-drawn animation still has a long life ahead of it. However, recently the pace of digital creation has risen considerably. In order to exist, artists, whether professional or casual, have to be highly productive which is not quite compatible with the long-term endeavor that producing a hand-drawn animation can be. -
			 It's become harder and harder to create hand-drawn animation as the demand has increased.
		In this paper we present 2DToonShade: a semi-automatic method for creating different types of shading and shadows in a hand-drawn animation. Our system provides an easy 2D light positioning tool and creates shades based on hand-drawn objects or characters. The user just has to click/tap/touch where he wants a shade to appear on the drawing. - 
			The tool provides an easy to use and interactive interface for the user.

2. Previous Work (Some Background)
	Petrović et al. [[11]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590148619300032#bib0011)

3. Interface
		We developed our 2DToonShade tool on top of Pencil2D [animation software](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/animation-software "Learn more about animation software from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [[40]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590148619300032#bib0040).
		Pencil2D is a free and open-source hand-drawn animation software developed in C++ and Qt.

4. Proposed Technique
		 Our system was implemented for vector images, although it can also be easily applied to raster images.
		 As illustrated in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590148619300032#fig0005), we make use of a spherical [coordinate system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/coordinate-system "Learn more about coordinate system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to represent the light position with respect to any point in the drawn layer.
		 The azimuth _ϕ_ represents the incoming light direction as projected on the canvas.
